(Chorus)
Yay-yay-yay-yeah
Babygirl, you got me losing my cool
Ever since I started over with you
It's like you got me opening up

(Verse)
I thought I'd be a Casa Nova
Ever since me and Needy Girl broke up
But now the lonely days are over
She's back 'cause she's got me opening up (Opening Up, Opening Up)

She's got me crying in the movies
She's got me calling her after school
I don't know what has got into me
'Cause I can't stop myself from acting like a fool

When I want it
When I need it
When my heart goes Boom Boom Boom
Everytime I feel it
I can't call it
Can't live without it
Tell me what number to dial
'Cause I've been strung out for a while
She's got me opening up

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Don't take it as some kind of diss
I'm trying to be an adonis
Everytime I'm gonna miss
Your type of touch, your type of kiss
I never thought I'd be annonymous
I guess that is not a myth
I won't be having none of this
Calling Lovers Annonymous

(Chorus)
