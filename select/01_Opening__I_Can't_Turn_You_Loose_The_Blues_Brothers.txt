Good Evening, Ladies and Gentlemen and welcome to the Universal Amphitheater.
Well, here it is the late 1970's going on 1985.
Y'know so much of the music we here today is pre-programmed electronic disco, we never get a chance to hear master bluesmen practicing their craft anymore.
By the year 2006, the music known today as the blues will exist only in the classical records department of your local public library.
So tonight, Ladies and Gentlemen, while we still can, let us welcome from Rock Island, Illinois, the bluesmen of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, The Blues Brothers!"
