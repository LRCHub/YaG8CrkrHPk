Good Evening,
Ladies and Gentlemen and welcome to the Universal Amphitheater.
Well, here it is the late 1970's going on 1985.
Y'know so much of the music we here today is pre-programmed
Electronic disco,
We never get a chance to hear master
Blues men practicing their craft anymore.
By the year 2006, the music known today as the blues will exist
Only in the classical records
Department of your local public library.
So tonight, Ladies and Gentlemen, while we still can,
Let us welcome from Rock Island, Illinois,
The blues men of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, The Blues Brothers!"
